    // This approach of setting delegatePackingProperty might be outdated
    // or need specific conditions. Modern Firebase testing often uses
    // MethodChannel mocking or firebase_auth_mocks/firestore_mocks.
    // However, sticking to the prompt for now.
    // Ensure Firebase.initializeApp has been called in test setup if this is used.
    // FirebaseAppNotInitializedException will be thrown if not.
    // It's also possible this is intended to be used AFTER a real or
    // method-channel-mocked Firebase.initializeApp.
    // The prompt is not explicit on the exact test setup sequence.
    // For robust mocking, consider if `firebase_core_platform_interface`
    // and `MethodChannelFirebase.delegate = ...` is more appropriate.
    // Given the simplicity, the prompt might assume a very basic mock.
    // Let's assume it's for a scenario where Firebase.app() is called.
    // Firebase.delegatePackingProperty = MockFirebaseApp(); // This line is problematic as delegatePackingProperty is not a static setter.
    // A common way to mock FirebaseApp is usually through dependency injection
    // or by mocking the MethodChannel for firebase_core.
    // The prompt's intention here is unclear for modern Firebase.
    // For now, I will comment it out as it won't compile as is.
    // The user might need to refine this based on their testing strategy.
    // Or, if they are using a very old firebase_core version, but ^3.6.0 is recent.

    // A more common pattern for unit testing with firebase_core is to mock
    // the FirebasePlatform interface if direct interaction with Firebase.app() is needed.
    // Or, ensure services that use Firebase are given a mock FirebaseApp instance.
    // The prompt's `Firebase.delegatePackingProperty = MockFirebaseApp();` is not a valid API.
    // I will leave the method empty for now, highlighting this issue.
    // log('FirebaseTestHelper.setupFirebaseForTesting: Needs review for Firebase core mocking strategy.'); // Removed direct log call
