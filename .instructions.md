# Flutter AI Guide Generator - Development Instructions

## Architecture and Project Structure

Use feature-first directory organization:

- Group files by feature, not by type (cubit/, view/, model/ within each feature)
- Place shared utilities in lib/core/ directory
- Keep related components and logic co-located within feature directories
- Use barrel exports (index.dart) for clean imports between features

## Flutter Development Standards

### Widget Implementation

Create StatelessWidget components wherever possible for better performance.

Use proper const constructors for all widgets to enable compile-time optimizations.

Implement proper widget composition over inheritance patterns.

Extract reusable widgets into dedicated files in the widgets/ directory.

### State Management with Cubit

Create separate files for state classes and cubit classes within each feature.

Use sealed classes or enums for type-safe state definitions with clear state variants.

Implement proper stream disposal in cubit classes using the built-in close() method.

Follow single responsibility principle - each cubit should manage one specific domain.

Use BlocProvider at the appropriate widget tree level to scope state properly.

### Navigation and Routing

Use go_router for declarative routing with type-safe route definitions.

Define all routes in a centralized router configuration file.

Implement proper route guards for authentication and authorization.

Use nested routing for complex navigation hierarchies.

### API Integration and Data Layer

Create dedicated repository classes for each data source or API endpoint.

Implement proper error handling with custom exception classes for different error types.

Use Dio for HTTP client with interceptors for authentication and logging.

Implement retry logic for failed network requests with exponential backoff.

Cache responses appropriately using local storage or in-memory caching.

### Firebase Integration

Use official Firebase plugins with proper initialization in main.dart.

Implement Firebase Authentication with proper error handling for all auth states.

Structure Firestore data with proper security rules and data validation.

Use Firebase Remote Config for feature flags and dynamic configuration.

Implement proper offline support with Firestore's built-in caching.

### AI and Machine Learning Integration

Create dedicated service classes for AI API interactions (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).

Implement proper rate limiting and quota management for AI service calls.

Handle streaming responses appropriately with proper error recovery.

Cache AI responses when appropriate to reduce API costs and improve performance.

Implement fallback mechanisms for AI service failures.

### Testing Requirements

Write unit tests for all business logic including cubits and repositories.

Include widget tests for critical UI components with proper test setup.

Mock external dependencies using mockito or similar mocking frameworks.

Test error scenarios and edge cases thoroughly.

Maintain minimum 80% code coverage across the codebase.

### Code Quality and Documentation

Add comprehensive JSDoc-style comments for all public methods and classes.

Use descriptive variable and method names that clearly indicate purpose.

Implement proper error messages that provide actionable feedback to users.

Follow Dart naming conventions: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.

### Performance Optimization

Implement proper list view optimization using ListView.builder for large datasets.

Use const widgets wherever possible to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.

Optimize image loading with proper caching and compression.

Implement lazy loading for expensive operations and large data sets.

Profile app performance regularly and address memory leaks promptly.

### Accessibility and User Experience

Include proper semantic labels and accessibility hints for screen readers.

Implement keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements.

Use sufficient color contrast and support for system accessibility settings.

Provide loading states and progress indicators for all async operations.

Implement proper error boundaries with user-friendly error messages.

### Security and Privacy

Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides.

Store sensitive data securely using flutter_secure_storage.

Implement proper certificate pinning for API communications.

Follow OWASP mobile security guidelines for authentication and data protection.

Never log sensitive user information or API keys in production builds.

## Code Generation Guidelines

When creating new features:

- Generate the complete feature folder structure with cubit/, view/, and model/ subdirectories
- Create index.dart files for clean exports
- Include proper state classes with loading, success, and error states
- Add comprehensive error handling throughout the feature

When implementing UI components:

- Use Material Design 3 components with proper theming
- Implement responsive design using MediaQuery and LayoutBuilder
- Add proper animations and transitions for better user experience
- Include accessibility features and semantic labels

When integrating APIs:

- Create typed model classes with proper JSON serialization
- Implement repository pattern with interface definitions
- Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Include proper logging for debugging and monitoring

## Firebase Specific Guidelines

For Firestore integration:

- Use typed model classes with fromMap and toMap methods
- Implement proper subcollection structure for related data
- Add proper security rules with field-level validation
- Use batch operations for multiple document updates

For Authentication:

- Implement proper sign-in flows with error handling
- Use Firebase Auth state listeners for reactive authentication
- Handle email verification and password reset flows
- Implement proper session management and token refresh

For Remote Config:

- Define feature flags with proper fallback values
- Implement A/B testing for experimental features
- Cache config values appropriately for offline use
- Use typed accessors for configuration values

## AI Integration Patterns

For prompt engineering:

- Create reusable prompt templates with variable substitution
- Implement proper context management for conversational AI
- Add prompt validation and sanitization before API calls
- Store successful prompts for reuse and optimization

For response handling:

- Parse AI responses with proper error checking
- Implement streaming response handling for real-time updates
- Add response caching to reduce API costs
- Provide fallback responses for AI service failures

For content generation:

- Validate generated content before displaying to users
- Implement content filtering for inappropriate responses
- Add proper attribution and source tracking
- Cache generated content appropriately for reuse
