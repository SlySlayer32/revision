# AI Pipeline Verification & Corrections

## üîç Pipeline Flow Analysis

Based on your flow diagram, I've identified and corrected several mismatches between the expected AI pipeline and the current implementation.

## Expected Flow (from your diagram)

```
1. User uploads image & marks object in Flutter app
2. Send marked image to AI pipeline
3. Gemini 2.0 Flash - Analyze marked area & generate removal prompt
4. Send image and prompt to next model
5. Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview - Generate new image using prompt
6. Return updated image to UI
```

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ‚ùå Issue 1: Wrong Model Configuration

**Problem:** Code was using `gemini-2.5-flash` for analysis instead of `gemini-2.0-flash`
**Fixed in:**

- `lib/core/config/ai_config.dart`
- `lib/core/constants/firebase_ai_constants.dart`
- `firebase/remoteconfig.template.json`

### ‚ùå Issue 2: Incorrect System Prompts

**Problem:** Prompts were generic image editing instead of object removal focused
**Fixed:** Updated all system prompts to focus on:

- Analyzing marked areas for removal
- Generating precise removal instructions
- Content-aware reconstruction
- Seamless object removal

### ‚ùå Issue 3: Missing Marked Object Integration

**Problem:** Pipeline was doing general image analysis instead of marked area analysis
**Fixed:** Updated `GeminiPipelineService` to:

- Accept marked areas as input
- Process marked objects specifically
- Generate removal-focused prompts

### ‚ùå Issue 4: Pipeline Service Structure

**Problem:** Service had wrong method names and flow
**Fixed:** Restructured to match diagram:

- `analyzeMarkedImage()` - Step 3: Gemini 2.0 Flash analysis
- `generateImageWithRemovals()` - Step 5: Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview generation
- `processImageWithMarkedObjects()` - Complete pipeline

## ‚úÖ Corrected Configuration

### Models

- **Step 3 Analysis:** `gemini-2.0-flash`
- **Step 5 Generation:** `gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`

### Prompts

- **Analysis Prompt:** Focuses on marked object analysis and removal instruction generation
- **Editing Prompt:** Focuses on content-aware object removal and background reconstruction

### Pipeline Flow

```dart
// New method signature matching your flow
Future<GeminiPipelineResult> processImageWithMarkedObjects({
  required Uint8List imageData,
  required List<Map<String, dynamic>> markedAreas,
}) async {
  // Step 3: Analyze marked areas with Gemini 2.0 Flash
  final removalPrompt = await analyzeMarkedImage(
    imageData: imageData,
    markedAreas: markedAreas,
  );

  // Step 5: Generate new image with Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview
  final generatedImageData = await generateImageWithRemovals(
    originalImageData: imageData,
    removalPrompt: removalPrompt,
  );

  return result;
}
```

## üîÑ Next Steps to Verify

1. **Update Firebase Remote Config:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only remoteconfig
   ```

2. **Test the Pipeline:**
   - Load an image in the app
   - Mark objects for removal
   - Verify Step 3 uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for analysis
   - Verify Step 5 uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview for generation

3. **Check Logs:**
   Look for these log messages:

   ```
   üîç Step 3: Analyzing marked areas with Gemini 2.0 Flash...
   üé® Step 5: Generating new image with Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview...
   ```

## üìù Remote Config Parameters

The corrected Remote Config template now has:

- `ai_gemini_model`: `"gemini-2.0-flash"` (Step 3)
- `ai_gemini_image_model`: `"gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation"` (Step 5)
- Updated system prompts focusing on object removal

## üö® Important Notes

1. **API Keys:** Ensure your Firebase project has access to both Gemini 2.0 Flash models
2. **Permissions:** Verify the models are enabled in your Google Cloud Console
3. **Testing:** The actual image generation depends on Google's API returning image data
4. **Fallbacks:** The code includes fallbacks for MVP functionality

Your pipeline should now match the expected flow diagram exactly! The key changes ensure that:

- Step 3 uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for marked area analysis
- Step 5 uses Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview for image generation
- All prompts focus on object removal rather than general editing
- The flow accepts marked areas as input for precise object removal
