# GitHub Copilot Implementation Request

## Current Issue: AI Processing Pipeline Not Working

**Problem**: When users click "Mark objects & Apply AI" button, the app shows loading briefly but returns to the marking screen without actually processing the image through the AI pipeline.

**Root Cause**: The UI button handler is not properly connected to the AI service methods.

## Request for GitHub Copilot

Please help me implement the complete AI processing workflow for this Flutter image editing app using Firebase AI Logic (formerly Vertex AI in Firebase).

### Current Working Components

- ✅ Firebase authentication with emulator
- ✅ Image gallery selection  
- ✅ Image marking/object selection UI
- ✅ AI service classes exist (but not properly connected)

### What Needs Implementation

#### 1. Fix the "Mark objects & Apply AI" Button Handler

The button currently shows loading but doesn't call the AI service. Need to:

- Connect button to AI processing workflow
- Show proper loading states with progress indicators
- Handle the complete AI pipeline: analysis → editing → results

#### 2. Implement Complete AI Pipeline

Need a two-step AI process:

1. **Analysis Step**: Send marked image to Gemini model to analyze and create editing prompt
2. **Editing Step**: Use the generated prompt with image editing AI to process the image

#### 3. Add Results Screen

Create a screen to show:

- Before/after image comparison
- AI analysis/editing details
- Save to gallery functionality

### Technical Requirements

#### Current Setup

- Flutter app with `firebase_ai: ^2.1.0`
- Using `flutter_bloc` for state management
- Firebase project ID: `revision-fc66c`
- AI service interface already exists in `lib/core/services/ai_service.dart`
- Vertex AI service implementation in `lib/core/services/vertex_ai_service.dart`

#### Desired User Flow

1. User selects image → ✅ Working
2. User marks objects on image → ✅ Working  
3. User clicks "Mark objects & Apply AI" → ❌ **FIX NEEDED**
4. App shows "AI is analyzing..." progress → ❌ **IMPLEMENT**
5. AI analyzes image and marked objects → ❌ **IMPLEMENT**
6. AI generates editing instructions → ❌ **IMPLEMENT**
7. App shows results screen with before/after → ❌ **IMPLEMENT**
8. User can save edited image → ❌ **IMPLEMENT**

#### Key Files to Update

- Image marking screen widget (wherever the button handler is)
- AI service implementation (ensure proper Firebase AI Logic usage)
- Create new results screen widget
- Add proper BLoC state management for AI processing

#### Firebase AI Logic Specifications

- Use `gemini-2.5-flash` model for analysis
- Implement proper error handling and timeouts (30 seconds)
- Handle image size limits (20MB max)
- Use system instructions for consistent AI responses

### Expected Implementation

```dart
// Button handler should look like this:
Future<void> _onMarkObjectsAndApplyAI() async {
  // 1. Validate inputs
  // 2. Show loading state
  // 3. Call AI service with image and markers
  // 4. Handle success/error states
  // 5. Navigate to results screen
}
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Button click triggers actual AI processing
- [ ] User sees progress indicators during processing
- [ ] AI analysis completes and returns meaningful results
- [ ] Results screen shows original vs processed image
- [ ] User can save the processed image
- [ ] Proper error handling for network/AI failures

### Priority: HIGH (Critical for MVP)

This is the core feature that makes the app functional. Everything else works, but the AI processing pipeline is the main value proposition.

Please implement this using current Flutter and Firebase AI Logic best practices, with proper error handling and user feedback throughout the process.
